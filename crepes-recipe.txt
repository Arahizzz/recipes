How to make crepes

    In a blender, combine the milk, eggs, butter, sugar, vanilla, salt and flour. Mix until batter is smooth (about 15-20 seconds).
    Spray non-stick cooking spray onto a 8 inch frying pan. Pour about 1/4 cup batter into the pan and cook over medium-low heat. Turn pan immediately from side to side to form an even circle.
